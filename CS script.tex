\section{Single-sex schools are not necessary.}
I think ``Single-sex schools are not necessary.'' I have two reasons.
First, in coeducational shcools, We can learn how to contact with girls.
We are always in the same room, so communicate with everyone, boys and girls.
But Single-sex schools is not. 
For example, xxx
Second, we can spend a relatively moral school life, because there are girl's eye.
We can't act silly, such as talking dirty topics, or xxx

\subsection{disagree}
My opinion is opposite of yours.
＃First, You said that unmarried person have more free[ly] time than married.
However, if you marry, you can share houcework with your wife.
For example, cooking, washing, xxx. 
There are so many tasks to live in your houce.
Unmarried person must do its tasks by yourself.

And second, about stress manegement.
＃you say 
I understand your opinion, but married persons has how to reduce their stress.
They can consult with his partner.

In addition, when you are old, also you need any help to live.
Then, your children will look after you.
Recentry, lonely death is a important issue, so it is often discussed in Japan.
To solve this problem, live with family.
